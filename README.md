# CREDIT-CARD-FRAUD-DETECTION-USING-SELF-ORGANIZING-MAPS-SOM-
This project uses a Self-Organizing Map to detect potential fraud in credit card applications. It involves data preprocessing, SOM training using ‘MiniSom’, visualization of outlier patterns, and extraction of suspicious applications based on the SOM’s distance map, helping identify possible fraudulent behavior in the dataset.
